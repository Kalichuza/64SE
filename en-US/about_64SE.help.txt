SHORT DESCRIPTION
    64SE is a PowerShell module for encoding and decoding strings and files using Base64.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The 64SE module provides a set of cmdlets that simplify the process of encoding strings and files to Base64 and decoding Base64 strings back to their original format.
    It supports the encoding and decoding of both strings and files, providing flexibility in handling different types of data.

    The module contains the following cmdlets:
    - Encode-StringToBase64
    - Decode-Base64ToString
    - Encode-FileToBase64
    - Decode-Base64ToFile

EXAMPLES
    For examples of how to use these cmdlets, see the detailed help for each cmdlet using `Get-Help <cmdlet-name> -Examples`.
